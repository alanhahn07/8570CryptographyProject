# 8570CryptographyProject

Repository to hold my Cryptography class Project on Zero Knowledge Proofs.

The project presentation may be found by clicking on Presentation8570.pdf, or clicking [here](https://github.com/alanhahn07/8570CryptographyProject/blob/main/8570%20Project/Presentation8570.pdf). 

The project is an expository one, in which I give a general idea of what Zero Knowledge proofs are, and then give a concrete example, the Feige - Fiat - Shamir Identification Scheme.

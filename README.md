# 8570CryptographyProject

Repository to hold my Cryptography class Project on Zero Knowledge Proofs.

The project presentation may be found by clicking on Presentation8570.pdf, or clicking here. 

The project is an expository one, in which I give a general idea of what Zero Knowledge proofs are, and then give a concrete example, the Feige - Fiat - Shamir Identification Scheme.
